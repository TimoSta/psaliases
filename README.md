# Ps-Aliases
As a heavy PowerShell user, you'll want to make your life easier by using short and easy-to-remember aliases for your most frequently used tools. This project aims to create a library of proven aliases that can simply be dropped into your workflow.

Inspired by and borrowing from [.aliases](https://github.com/algotech/dotaliases).

## Available Aliases
- [**Git**](https://github.com/TimoSta/psaliases/blob/master/doc/git.md) - the version control system
